			<h1>Impressionism</h1>
			<div>
				
				<h3>Impressionism is one of the most influential art movements of the 19th century, originating in France during the 1860s. It marked a departure from traditional academic painting, embracing new techniques and subjects that reflected the rapidly changing modern world. This movement focused on capturing the transient effects of light, atmosphere, and everyday life, often painted en plein air (outdoors) for immediacy and freshness. The name "Impressionism" derives from Claude Monet's painting Impression, Sunrise (1872), a work that encapsulates the movement's spirit.
