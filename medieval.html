			<h1>The Medieval Period</h1>
			<div>
				<h2>Early Medieval (5th-10th Century CE)</h2>
				<h3>Early Medieval Period follows the fall of the Western Roman Empire, and is a time of frequent political unrest and warefare. This unsteadiness is 
					reflected in the art through themes of combat, references to political leaders, a growing connection to religion, and visual storytelling. 
					During this time, there was a lack of reading and writing skills among common people. Art was a way to convey messages, tell stories and 
					teach the masses through strong uses of symbolism. </h3>
