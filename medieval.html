		<h1>The Medieval Period</h1>
		<div>
			<h2>Early Medieval (5th-10th Century CE)</h2>
			<h3>Early Medieval Period follows the fall of the Western Roman Empire, and is a time of frequent political unrest and warefare. This unsteadiness is 
				reflected in the art through themes of combat, references to political leaders, a growing connection to religion, and visual storytelling. 
				During this time, there was a lack of reading and writing skills among common people. Art was a way to convey messages, tell stories and 
				teach the masses through strong uses of symbolism. </h3>

			<h2>Late Medieval (1300-1500 CE)</h2>
			<h3>In the Late Medieval period, we will start to see evidence of early modern world; this is the precursor to the Renaissance. Constantine ends 
				Persecution of Christianity and spreads the religion by building basilicas to bring masses of people together. Other significant events 
				during the Late Medieval Period include famine, disease, and the Black Death (1346-1353).</h3>
