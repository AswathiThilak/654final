				<h1>The Medieval Period</h1>

			<div >
				<h2>Early Medieval (5th-10th Century CE)</h2>
				<h3>Early Medieval Period follows the fall of the Western Roman Empire, and is a time of frequent political unrest and warefare. This unsteadiness is 
					reflected in the art through themes of combat, references to political leaders, a growing connection to religion, and visual storytelling. 
					During this time, there was a lack of reading and writing skills among common people. Art was a way to convey messages, tell stories and 
					teach the masses through strong uses of symbolism. </h3>

				<h2>High Medieval (1000-1250 CE)</h2>
				<h3>The High Medieval Period was a time in European history that began after Emperor Otto Iâ€™s defeat of the Hungarians at Lechfeld in 955. This began 
					a period of some internal stability, which lacked before. People began to develop more of a 'national' identity that differed from their 
					religious identity. They wre able to grow in strength and proudly present themselves as conquerers and adventurers. The Holy Crusades took 
					place during this time, as well as the rise of feudalism. As a result, we will see themes like religions and secular subject matter in High 
					Medieval Art. This period is often characterized as the epitome of Medieval Art.</h3>

				<h2>Late Medieval (1300-1500 CE)</h2>
				<h3>In the Late Medieval period, we will start to see evidence of early modern world; this is the precursor to the Renaissance. Constantine ends 
					Persecution of Christianity and spreads the religion by building basilicas to bring masses of people together. Other significant events 
					during the Late Medieval Period include famine, disease, and the Black Death (1346-1353). We will start to see more naturalistic depictions 
					of the human form.</h3>
