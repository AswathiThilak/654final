		<h1>Renaissance Paintings</h1>
		<div>
			
			<h3>The Early Renaissance (1400-1479) marked a cultural rebirth in Italy, where artists moved away from solely religious themes to focus on more humanistic, emotional, and expressive depictions of individuals. They incorporated new knowledge of math and architecture to create “illusionary realities” in their works. The High Renaissance (1475-1525) represents the peak of this movement with artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael building on Early Renaissance innovations. This period emphasized beauty in art, with a focus on architectural elements like quadrata and the development of ceiling paintings. </h3>
